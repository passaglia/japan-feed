                       Josh Billings (1818 - 1885) On a long enough timeline. The survival rate for everyone drops to zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                       Chuck Palahniuk (1962 - ), Fight Club, 1996 It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                       Charlotte Bronte (1816 - 1855), Jane Eyre, 1847 Remember! Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights - then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward, that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend.
