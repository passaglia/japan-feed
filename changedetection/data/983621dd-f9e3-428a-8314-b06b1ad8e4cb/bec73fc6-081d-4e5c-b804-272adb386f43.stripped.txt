Some people are not capable of love, and it might be wise to let them go along with your anger. Wish them well, and let them go their way.

                       Once you can laugh at your own weaknesses, you can move forward. Comedy breaks down walls. It opens up people. If you're good, you can fill up those openings with something positive. Maybe... combat some of the ugliness in the world.

                       Being in politics is like being a football coach. You have to be smart enough to understand the game, and dumb enough to think it's important.

                       Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, every day, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do. It is bad for the mind to be always part of unanimity.                                                                                                              
                       Christopher Morley (1890 - 1957) The act of nutrition is not a purely physiological event... The family meal is a formality that cultivates in us... a capacity for sharing, generosity, thoughtfulness, a talent for civilized conversation.                                                                                                 
                       Francine Du Plessix Gray Don't be discouraged by a failure. It can be a positive experience. Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to seek earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out some form of error which we shall afterwards carefully avoid.
