Read books online      If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out.

                       Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day; wisdom consists of not exceeding the limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                       Elbert Hubbard (1856 - 1915) We find it hard to believe that other people's thoughts as our own, but they probably are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                       James Harvey Robinson I bid him look into the lives of men as though into a mirror, and from others to take an example for himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                       Terence (185 BC - 159 BC) That is the American story. People, just like you, following their passions, determined to meet the times on their own terms. They weren't doing it for the money. Their titles weren't fancy. But they changed the course of history and so can you.
