  * Author Index       Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  * Subject Index      Michael Crichton (1942 - 2008), Caltech Michelin Lecture, January 17, 2003 We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. They will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks to come. We've been asked to pause for a reality check; we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope.
