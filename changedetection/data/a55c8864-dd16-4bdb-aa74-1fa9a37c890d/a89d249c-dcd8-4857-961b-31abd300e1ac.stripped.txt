  * Subject Index      Thomas H. Huxley (1825 - 1895) My Father taught me to weigh my words carefully, and speak up only when I had something insightful to add to the proceedings, or something really funny to say. He also taught me that if I couldn’t be that kind of guy in real life, that I could earn a healthy living pretending to be that guy in the movies – particularly when paired up with a long haired stoner.

                       It really doesn't matter if the person who hurt you deserves to be forgiven. Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself.
